// The register allocator.
//
// Turns the IR's unlimited virtual registers into the CPU's real ones, spilling
// to the stack when more values are live at once than there are registers. It
// replaces the original brgemm kernel's hand-managed register numbering. The
// allocator is responsible for deciding WHO to spill, which relies on three
// ideas:
//   1. liveness
//   2. control-flow graph
//   3. linear scan
//
// It is designed to be generic. It knows only register kinds and control
// flow, nothing about the computation (brgemm, brgemv, copy, etc.) or the ISA.
//
// 1. Liveness
//
// A value is `live` at a point if it will be read again before being
// overwritten. Two values that are live at the same point interfere. They
// cannot share a register. So the allocator's input is each value's live span,
// and its job is to pack non-interfering spans onto the same register.
//
// 2. The Control-Flow Graph
//
// To know what is read later we must know what runs after what. In this IR
// that is nearly trivial. Each operation flows to the next, with three
// exceptions:
//   1. loop_end has two successors. It can fall through, or jump back to the
//      body start (`back-edge`).
//   2. jz has two successors. It can fall through, or jump to its label
//      (`forward-edge`).
//   3. jmp has one successor. It redirects to its label (`forward edge`).
//
//     Back-edge example:
//
//     0  loop_begin      <- back-edge returns here
//     1    v = load [ptr]
//     2    acc += v * x
//     3    ptr += stride
//     4  loop_end        -> 5, or jump back to 0
//     5  store acc
//
// So both branches and the back-edge depart from a straight list. The back-edge
// is special because it forms a cycle. A cycle is the one thing that forces the
// liveness pass to repeat, as the next section explains. Forward branches do
// not. There are no basic blocks. Every operation is a node.
//
// Backward Liveness Analysis
//
// Liveness is computed backwards and iterated. Needed here depends on uses
// later, so we go through the list back to front. Each operation keeps alive
// whatever its successors need, minus what it overwrites, plus what it reads.
//
// The back-edge makes this take more than one pass. Iterate to a fixed point
// is a static analysis of the program text. We don't need to know the loop
// counter values. We re-iterate over the operation list until a pass changes
// nothing. That stable result is the `fixed point`.
//
// Why a second pass is ever needed: a `ptr` read at the top of the body
// (see the back-edge example) and advanced at the bottom is, through the
// back-edge, the value the next iteration reads at the top. So it must be live
// across the whole body. The first pass does not yet know the loop start needs
// it. The next pass propagates that, and it appears. This settles in a handful
// of passes. The count scales with loop nesting depth, not with how many times
// the loop runs. The result is liveness valid for every possible execution at
// once.
//
// 3. Linear Scan
//
// Collapse each value's liveness to one [start, end] interval, ignoring holes.
// That simplification is what keeps this cheap. If we need, we can enable
// intervals split to improve register allocation under pressure.
//
//     v0 |=================|   (0..9)
//     v1   |===|               (1..3)
//     v2         |=======|     (4..8)
//     v3           |=====|     (5..8)
//        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
//
// Per register file, the scan goes through the operations left to right,
// keeping the intervals that hold a register (`active`). A register is freed
// when its interval ends. When none is free, one of the overlapping intervals
// has to go to the stack. In the picture, with two registers, at t=5 both are
// taken by v0 and v2, so one of them is spilled to make room for v3.
//
// A spilled value still has to be in a register while an operation reads or
// writes it. The allocator hands out such a register for the duration of that
// one operation, called a `temp` (see `temp_reg_t`). The scan maintains this
// rule:
//
//   Rule: at every operation, each operand is in a register, its own or a
//   temp. Every other live value holds a register or sits in its stack slot.
//
// At t=5 the operation defines v3, so v3 is one of its operands. By the rule
// v3 needs a register at 5 either way, its own or a temp. So spilling v3 frees
// nothing, and the choice is between v0 and v2. In general, only a value the
// operation does not touch frees a register by going to the stack.
//
// 4. Spill Weights
//
// Which one to spill is decided by weight. The weight of a value estimates how
// much code it costs to keep that value on the stack instead of in a register.
//
// Every operation that reads or writes a value adds to that value's weight. How
// much it adds depends on how many loops enclose the operation, because the
// operation runs once per iteration of every loop around it. The iteration
// counts are run-time values, so the allocator assumes `loop_weight` iterations
// for every loop. An operation outside every loop then adds 1, one loop deep
// adds `loop_weight`, and two loops deep adds `loop_weight` squared.
//
// `loop_weight` is 10. It does not model the real iteration count. It only has
// to keep a value that the loop nest references ahead of one referenced only
// outside the nest. At 10 it takes ten references outside the nest to match a
// single reference inside it, so a value can be referenced several times
// outside and still rank below a value the nest touches once. 10 is a starting
// point that looks reasonable for that, and it can be adjusted as needed.
//
// Below is a kernel that walks a block row by row, with `m` counting the rows
// and `n` the elements in a row. Both counters are ordinary values that occupy
// registers. The three columns are the operation's loop depth, what it adds
// with `loop_weight` at 10, and the values it reads or writes:
//
//                                       depth  adds  to
//     0  load_param ptr_a                  0      1  ptr_a
//     1  loop_begin m                      0      1  m
//     2    load_param ptr_b                1     10  ptr_b
//     3    loop_begin n                    1     10  n
//     4      v = load [ptr_b]              2    100  ptr_b, v
//     5      store [ptr_a], v              2    100  ptr_a, v
//     6    loop_end n                      2    100  n
//     7    ptr_a += stride                 1     10  ptr_a
//     8  loop_end m                        1     10  m
//
// A `loop_begin` sets its counter once on entry, so it sits outside its own
// loop. A `loop_end` tests the counter on every turn, so it sits inside. That
// is why rows 1 and 8 differ in depth.
//
// The totals are `v` at 200, `ptr_a` at 111, `ptr_b` at 110, `n` at 110, and
// `m` at 11. The interval with the smallest total is the one spilled, so `m`
// goes first. It is the only value here that is never touched two loops deep.
//
// Weight counts references, the reads and writes of a value. It does not count
// live range. A pointer that is live across a loop but never touched inside it
// adds nothing for that loop. A pointer read by every store in the loop body
// adds once per store. Both have the same live range, and only the reference
// count separates them.
//
// When two values have the same weight, the end of the live interval decides.
// The value whose interval ends last is spilled, because among the tied values
// it is the one that would otherwise occupy a register the longest.

//   1. Computing `live_in` at operation `i`:
//      A variable is live before `i` if `i` uses it, or if it is needed
//      later and not overwritten by `i`.
//      Formula: live_in[i] = use[i] U (live_out[i] - def[i])
//
//   2. Computing `live_out` at operation `i`:
//      A variable is live after `i` if any successor may need it.
//      Formula: live_out[i] = union of live_in over all successors of `i`
//
// Scan each `i` from last to first, and repeat the whole scan until nothing
// changes (the fixed point). Successors are `i+1` for a plain operation, the
// label for jmp/jz, and `i+1` plus the loop body start for loop_end
// (the back-edge).
//
// Small example: `p` is read at the top of a loop body and rewritten at the
// bottom:
//
//   0  loop_begin
//   1    v = load [p]      (p read)
//   2    p = p + stride    (p rewritten)
//   3  loop_end            (back-edge to 0)
//
// `p` must be live across the whole body, because the value written at 2 is
// read at 1 on the next turn. One backward pass finds most of it. The entry to
// loop_end needs the back-edge, so it appears only on the second pass. A third
// pass changes nothing, which is the fixed point.

// Assign physical registers within a single physical register file. A file may
// serve more than one register kind (e.g. vec and mask on AVX2*).
//
// A spilled value lives in its stack slot for its whole live range. No
// register holds it between operations. At each operation that references it,
// it gets a temp, a register that holds it for that one operation. The value
// is loaded into the temp before the operation if the operation reads it, and
// stored back to the slot after if the operation writes it.
//
// The scan goes through the operations in order, keeping an `active` set of
// intervals that hold a register. At operation `i`:
//   1. Expire old intervals:
//      Remove every active interval that ended before `i`, freeing its
//      register.
//
//   2. Count the demand:
//      `i` needs a register from the free pool for
//      - each interval that starts at `i`
//      - each operand of `i` that is already spilled, as its temp. At most
//        `max_temps_per_op` temps of each kind are counted.
//
//   3. Spill if necessary:
//      While fewer registers are free than the demand, spill the lightest
//      active interval that is not an operand of `i`, with ties broken on the
//      latest end. A mask is never chosen, since its kind gets no temps.
//
//   4. Hand out registers:
//      Intervals that start at `i` take theirs and become active. An interval
//      left without one is spilled. Then each spilled operand counted in step
//      2 takes a temp while registers last. Temps return to the free pool
//      after `i`.
//
// A value spilled in step 3 is on the stack at all its references, including
// those before `i` that the scan has already passed, and they need temps too.
// From its start up to `i` the value held its register alone, so that register
// is free at each earlier reference and becomes its temp there. At each later
// reference, step 2 counts it as a spilled operand and step 4 hands it a temp.
//
// When every register holds an operand of `i` or a mask, step 3 has nothing to
// spill. An operand left without a register then gets no temp, which the
// emitter reports by failing the kernel.
//
// Spilled values are assigned stack slots starting at `frame`, increasing by
// `slot_size` per spill.
//
// Example with 2 registers, r0 and r1. The diagram shows the final state,
// after the scan has finished. `|` marks each value's live interval. The
// register columns show what each register holds in the final allocation. `.`
// is free.
//
//                 live       register
//                 a  b  c    r0      r1
//   0  a = 1      |          a temp  .
//   1  b = 2      |  |       .       b
//   2  c = 3      |  |  |    c       b
//   3  b += c     |  |  |    c       b
//   4  a += 1     |          a temp  .
//
// How the scan gets there:
//   0: `a` takes r0.
//   1: `b` takes r1.
//   2: `c` needs a register and none is free. `a` and `b` are not operands of
//      2 and weigh 3 each, so the later end spills `a` and `c` takes r0. The
//      spill covers all of `a`, including 0 and 1, which the scan has passed.
//      `a` held r0 alone up to 2, so r0 becomes its temp at 0. At 1 `a` is not
//      an operand, so it needs no register there and r0 is free.
//   3: `b` and `c` are in registers.
//   4: `b` and `c` have ended. `a` is a spilled operand and gets r0 as its
//      temp.
//
// For `a` this becomes, with `[a]` its stack slot:
//   0: mov r0, 1
//      mov [a], r0
//   4: mov r0, [a]
//      add r0, 1
//      mov [a], r0

// Run full register allocation pipeline.
// Returns, for each virtual register, either a physical register or a spill
// slot, and for each operation the temps of its spilled operands.
//
// The pipeline:
//   1. Compute liveness (live_in for each operation).
//   2. Convert liveness into a single interval per virtual register:
//        start[v] = first operation where `v` is defined, used, or live_in
//        end[v]   = last such operation
//      and record the distinct operands of each operation.
//   3. Weight each virtual register by how often it is referenced, so that the
//      scan spills the lowest-weight value rather than the longest-lived one.
//   4. Run linear-scan allocation per physical register file, sharing a single
//      stack frame across all files.
//
// Interval construction is intentionally conservative. If a value is live in
// disjoint regions (e.g. 3-7 and 20-25), it is merged into [3-25]. This
// ignores holes but guarantees correctness and keeps the algorithm simple.
//
// This approximation is usually acceptable because the most important values
// are hot loop-invariant pointers (e.g. base pointers for C and batch data),
// which are intended to remain in registers for the entire kernel anyway.
// For these cases, merging gaps has no practical cost. The only downside
// appears when a value has a true dead region while registers are scarce,
// where the gap could otherwise be reused.
//
// Hole-aware live-range splitting would recover that reuse. It is not planned,
// because the weights already keep the values that matter in registers, and
// splitting adds interval bookkeeping and reload placement. Recorded here in
// case pressure ever makes it worthwhile. Such splits would have to respect
// the weights and must not split a value inside a loop that carries it.
