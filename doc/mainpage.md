Developer Guide {#dev_guide}
============================

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
The library is optimized for Intel 64/AMD64 architecture based processors,
Arm(R) 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)-based processors, and Intel Graphics.
oneDNN has experimental support for the following architectures: NVIDIA\* GPU,
AMD\* GPU, OpenPOWER\* Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz\* (s390x), and RISC-V.

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
developers interested in improving application performance. Deep learning
practitioners should use one of the applications enabled with oneDNN.
