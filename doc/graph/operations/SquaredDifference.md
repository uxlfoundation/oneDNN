SquaredDifference {#dev_guide_op_squareddifference}
===================================================

## General

SquaredDifference operation performs element-wise subtraction operation with
two given tensors applying multi-directional broadcast rules, after that each
result of the subtraction is squared.

Before performing arithmetic operation, \f$src_1\f$ and \f$src_2\f$ are
broadcasted if their shapes are different and `auto_broadcast` attributes is not
`none`. Broadcasting is performed according to `auto_broadcast` value. After
broadcasting SquaredDifference does the following with the input tensors:

\f[ dst_i = (src\_1_i - src\_2_i)^2 \f]

## Operation attributes

Attribute Name | Description | Value Type | Supported Values | Required or Optional
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
[auto_broadcast](@ref dnnl::graph::op::attr::auto_broadcast) | Specifies rules used for auto-broadcasting of input tensors. | string | `none`, `numpy`(default) | Optional

## Execution arguments

The inputs and outputs must be provided according to below index order when
constructing an operation.

### Inputs
