//   (for example: gpr 0=rax, ..., 15=r15 and vec 0=ymm0, ..., 15=ymm15).
//   In this case, `slot` is not used.
//
// - If `spilled == true`, the value is stored on the stack at byte offset
//   `slot` in the spill area. In this case, `phys` is not used.
//   The emitter moves the value through a temp register at each operation
//   that reads or writes it (see `temp_reg_t`).

//   have no location. `spilled` is false and `phys` is -1.

// caps are upper bounds that come from the IR alone, the same on every target.
// Whether a value can spill is up to its file (see `reg_file_t::spillable`), so

//   operand, up to `max_temps_per_op` of each kind. It is indexed by operation.

//   values. The kernel reserves this space with a single `sub rsp`.

// A file is a set of physical registers, and any of them can hold any vreg

// Two kinds may share one, e.g. on AVX2* a mask is a vector register, so `vec`
// and `mask` map to the same file and compete for the same pool. On AVX-512 a
// mask is a k-register and has its own file. A tile has one file per tile shape
// in the tile configuration of the kernel, so one kind can have several files
// and the number of files depends on the kernel.
//
// `kind_to_file` holds the files of each kind as a range of `files`, indexed by
// `(int)reg_kind_t`. The files are ordered gpr, vec, mask (AVX-512 only), then
// the tile files in the order their shapes first appear in the tile
// configuration. A kind with no file, such as tile in a kernel without tiles,
// has an empty range.

//
// A value is `live` at operation `i` if some future operation may still
// read it before it is overwritten. In other words, the value must be kept
// available because it might be needed later.
//
// Two values that are live at the same operation cannot share a register.
//
// Backward data-flow to a fixed point. For each operation `i`:
//
//   1. Computing `live_in` at operation `i`:
//      A variable is live before `i` if `i` uses it, or if it is needed
//      later and not overwritten by `i`.
//      Formula: live_in[i] = use[i] U (live_out[i] - def[i])
//
//   2. Computing `live_out` at operation `i`:
//      A variable is live after `i` if any successor may need it.
//      Formula: live_out[i] = union of live_in over all successors of `i`
//
// Scan each `i` from last to first, and repeat the whole scan until nothing
// changes (the fixed point). Successors are `i+1` for a plain operation, `i+1`
// plus the loop body start for loop_end (the back-edge), `i+1` plus the else
// body or the if_end for if_begin, and the if_end for _else.
//
// Small example: `p` is read at the top of a loop body and rewritten at the
// bottom:
//
//   0  loop_begin
//   1    v = load [p]      (p read)
//   2    p = p + stride    (p rewritten)
//   3  loop_end            (back-edge to 0)
//
// `p` must be live across the whole body, because the value written at 2 is
// read at 1 on the next turn. One backward pass finds most of it. The entry to
// loop_end needs the back-edge, so it appears only on the second pass. A third
// pass changes nothing, which is the fixed point.
