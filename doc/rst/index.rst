oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) Developer Guide and Reference
=========================================================================

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.

The library is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture Processors, Intel Graphics, and Arm(R) 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)-based processors. oneDNN has experimental support for the following architectures: NVIDIA* GPU, AMD* GPU, OpenPOWER* Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz* (s390x), and RISC-V.
