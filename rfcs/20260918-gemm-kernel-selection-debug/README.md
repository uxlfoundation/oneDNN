# JIT GPU GEMM Kernel Selection: Debugging and Override

## Summary

Add selection logs and per-primitive kernel overrides for oneDNN JIT GEMM on
Intel GPUs. Developers and external tuners can inspect candidates, select a
kernel by rank, catalog index, or strategy string, and read back the finalized
strategy for replay.

Readback uses `ONEDNN_VERBOSE=xe=info`; overrides use an internal C API or
benchdnn's `--kernel` option. These features require `ONEDNN_DEV_MODE=ON` and
are compiled out of release builds. There is no query API or ABI guarantee.

## Motivation

Existing debugging tools leave four gaps:

- Selection logs lack a shared identifier linking candidates to the chosen
  kernel and do not translate scores into estimated time.
- `GEMM_KERNEL` applies globally, accepts only a full strategy string, and
  asserts on invalid input.
- The chosen kernel is logged before finalization, so the string does not
  describe what ran and cannot be replayed.
- External tuners lack an API to override selection per problem.

## Proposal

### 1. Selection logging

Each candidate has a **global catalog index**, stable across runs using the
same catalog build, and a **rank**, assigned by the evaluator for the current
problem (`0` is the default choice).

`ONEDNN_VERBOSE=xe=<level>` accepts either a severity name or its integer value:

| Level | Integer | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `info` | `150` | Finalized chosen kernel |
| `debug` | `160` | Every considered candidate, every skip, and the built kernel |

Candidate, skip, and choice lines use the same aligned catalog index. Candidate
and choice lines have these formats:

```text
[<global>] consider score:<score> [<ms>ms] <catalog strategy>
[<global>] use <rank>/<count>[ pin=k|pin=g] <finalized strategy>
```

The score is evaluator cost in aggregate EU-cycles; lower is better. Estimated
time is `score / (eu_count * clock_MHz * 1e3)` milliseconds, omitted when the
clock is unavailable. It is an idealized comparison aid, not measured runtime.

Real output (PVC, `xe=debug`, `512x1024:1024x2048`):

```text

```

`consider` prints the catalog strategy; `use` prints the finalized strategy,
including cache hints and any dispatch suffix described below. The strings
therefore differ even when their catalog index matches. `pin=k` marks a rank
override; `pin=g` marks a catalog-index override.

### 2. Kernel override

An override on the primitive attribute forces kernel selection for that
primitive. It accepts three forms:

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `N` | Candidate with rank `N` (`0` = default) |
| `gN` | Candidate with global catalog index `N` |
| `gemm ...` | Full strategy string from a `use` line |

Both index forms depend on the catalog build, and rank also depends on the
problem. Persist strategy strings for replay. Invalid overrides return
`unimplemented` instead of asserting. The generator also rejects degenerate
strategies that would otherwise crash.

A full-strategy override is logged as:

```text
[override] use <finalized strategy>
```

#### Poor-man tuning

Sweep ranks from `0` to `<count> - 1`, compare performance, and capture the
fastest candidate's strategy for replay. For a problem with five candidates:

```sh
for i in 0 1 2 3 4; do
    ONEDNN_VERBOSE=xe=info ONEDNN_PRIMITIVE_CACHE_CAPACITY=0 \
        ./build/tests/benchdnn/benchdnn -v5 --engine=gpu --mode=F \
        --cold-cache=all --matmul --kernel="$i" --dt=bf16 8x1024:1024x4096
done | grep perf,gpu
```

```text
perf,gpu,jit:gemm:any,,--mode=F --engine=gpu --cold-cache=all --matmul --dt=bf16:bf16:bf16 --kernel=0 8x1024:1024x4096,0.0671089,164.855,0.01744,3847.99,0.019875,3376.54
perf,gpu,jit:gemm:any,,--mode=F --engine=gpu --cold-cache=all --matmul --dt=bf16:bf16:bf16 --kernel=1 8x1024:1024x4096,0.0671089,165.327,0.01728,3883.61,0.0198,3389.34
perf,gpu,jit:gemm:any,,--mode=F --engine=gpu --cold-cache=all --matmul --dt=bf16:bf16:bf16 --kernel=2 8x1024:1024x4096,0.0671089,25.0774,0.0144,4660.34,0.0152833,4391
perf,gpu,jit:gemm:any,,--mode=F --engine=gpu --cold-cache=all --matmul --dt=bf16:bf16:bf16 --kernel=3 8x1024:1024x4096,0.0671089,37.0898,0.0144,4660.34,0.0151889,4418.27
perf,gpu,jit:gemm:any,,--mode=F --engine=gpu --cold-cache=all --matmul --dt=bf16:bf16:bf16 --kernel=4 8x1024:1024x4096,0.0671089,689.267,0.02432,2759.41,0.0306103,2192.36
```

Compare the `perf,gpu` lines using the same performance column. Here rank `3`
reaches about 1.3x the default's throughput in the final GFLOPS column.

### 3. Reading back and replaying the kernel

Copy the finalized strategy, starting at `gemm` and including any dispatch
suffix, from the `use` line into `--kernel` or the override API. Exclude the log
prefix, indices, and optional `pin=` marker.

For batch runs, `use` lines go to stdout. Associate each with the adjacent
benchdnn `N:STATUS` line; rejected cases have no preceding `use` line. Set
`ONEDNN_PRIMITIVE_CACHE_CAPACITY=0` to obtain one line per case.

#### Dispatch geometry

The evaluator derives `k0` and `wgK` outside the strategy grammar. Replaying
only the strategy can recompute different geometry, particularly for
k-parallel kernels. To preserve these values, append:

```text
<strategy> | dispatch k0=<value> wgK=<value>
```

The suffix is emitted for non-trivial geometry (`k0 > 0` or `wgK > 1`), including
non-k-parallel kernels. The parser strips the suffix before parsing the
strategy and honors its values. This preserves `k0` and `wgK`; it does not
guarantee identical execution in all circumstances.

### API and benchdnn

The internal C API sets the override on a primitive attribute:

```c
dnnl_status_t dnnl_impl_gpu_intel_set_kernel_override(
        dnnl_primitive_attr_t attr, const char *kernel);
```

The override is stored in `gpu_primitive_attr_t` and participates in the
primitive cache key.

benchdnn exposes the same forms through `--kernel=STR` for GPU execution with a
dev-mode library. Quote strategy strings because they contain spaces; generated
reproduction commands preserve the quoting.

## Scope and compatibility

- Default kernel selection is unchanged unless an override is set.
- GPU matmul accepts a GPU attribute to forward `grf_per_thread`, `use_dpas`,
  and the override to the inner GEMM. The check uses `engine_kind::gpu`, but
  only the Intel path consumes the attribute. CPU matmul continues to reject it.

## Open questions

1. **API scope:** Keep `dnnl_impl_gpu_intel_set_kernel_override` specific to
   Intel GPUs, or use a broader `dnnl_impl_*` API that other backends could
   implement?
2. **Index forms:** Does exposing both rank (`N`) and catalog index (`gN`)
   justify the potential confusion, or is rank alone sufficient?
