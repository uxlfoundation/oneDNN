Quantized SDPA {#dev_guide_graph_sdpa_quantized}
================================================

## Overview

Quantized Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) applies lower precision
technologies to the SDPA pattern to reduce memory bandwidth and improve
computation throughput during inference. In quantized SDPA, the input Query,
Key, and Value tensors are stored in lower precision data types such as
`u8`/`s8` (INT8) or `f8_e4m3`/`f8_e5m2` (FP8) along with scales and zero-points
data. Both INT8 and FP8 quantized SDPA share the same pattern structure,
differing only in the data types used for the quantized tensors. The
quantization can be either static, where scales and zero-points are provided as
operation attributes, or dynamic, where scales and zero-points are provided as
runtime input tensors. This approach is commonly used in inference scenarios
where reduced precision is acceptable for improved performance.

The notations used in this topic are:

- N: The mini-batch size.
- H: The number of multi-head.
- S: The sequence length.
- D: The size of each head (head size).

## Quantized SDPA Pattern

The quantized SDPA pattern is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using
oneDNN Graph API. oneDNN extends the [floating-point SDPA pattern](@ref dev_guide_graph_sdpa)
by inserting Dequantize and Quantize operations around the core SDPA
computations. The supported pattern is as follows. The blue nodes are required
while the brown nodes are optional.

oneDNN Graph API leverages inserting Quantize and Dequantize operations around
floating-point operations to express the corresponding lower precision
computation. Compared to a typical floating-point SDPA pattern, there are a few
differences:

1. Two Dequantize operations are applied to the quantized Query (q_Q) and Key
   (q_K) tensors before the dot products between Query and Key. See
   [Dequantize](@ref dev_guide_op_dequantize) operation in Graph API.
2. After SoftMax, a Quantize operation converts the intermediate `f32`
   probabilities to the quantized type, followed by a Dequantize operation to
   convert back to `f32` for the second MatMul. This Quantize-Dequantize pair
   models the quantization loss between the two MatMul operations. See
   [Quantize](@ref dev_guide_op_quantize) operation in Graph API.
3. A Dequantize operation is applied to the quantized Value (q_V) tensor before
   the second MatMul.
4. A Quantize operation is applied after the second MatMul to produce the final
   quantized output.
5. The Scale and Mask nodes remain optional and follow the same definition
   as in the floating-point SDPA pattern.

The pattern also supports a dynamic quantization variant. In this variant, the
Dequantize and Quantize operations described above are replaced by their dynamic
counterparts, [DynamicDequantize](@ref dev_guide_op_dynamicdequantize) and
[DynamicQuantize](@ref dev_guide_op_dynamicquantize), which take the scales and
zero-points as runtime input tensors instead of operation attributes. INT8 and
FP8 data types are supported in both the static and dynamic variants.

### Quantization Attributes and Inputs

For the static quantization variant, each Quantize and Dequantize operation
requires the following attributes:

- `qtype`: The quantization type. Currently `per_tensor` is supported for
  quantized SDPA.
- `scales`: A vector of scaling factors used for the quantization. It must
  contain single value when `qtype` is set to `per_tensor`.
- `zps`: A vector of zero-points used for the quantization. It is optional and
  can be specified when asymmetric quantization is needed. Once set, it must
  contain a single value when `qtype` is set to `per_tensor`.

For the dynamic quantization variant, each DynamicQuantize and DynamicDequantize
operation takes the scales and zero-points as runtime input tensors instead of
attributes, and supports specifying the scale dimensions via the `mask`
attribute.

## Data Types

oneDNN supports the quantized SDPA pattern with the following quantized data
types for Query, Key, Value, and output. You can specify the data type via the
input and output data type fields of logical tensors for each operation. The
definition of the data types and support status on different CPU and GPU
platforms follow the general description in @ref dev_guide_data_types.

| Query     | Key       | Value     | Dst           |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:--------------|
| u8        | u8        | u8        | u8 / f32      |
| s8        | s8        | s8        | s8 / f32      |
| f8_e4m3   | f8_e4m3   | f8_e4m3   | f8_e4m3 / f32 |
| f8_e5m2   | f8_e5m2   | f8_e5m2   | f8_e5m2 / f32 |

Notes:
- The intermediate computation is always performed in `f32`.
- All Dequantize outputs and Quantize inputs use `f32` data type.
- The Scale and Mask tensors use `f32` data type.
- The final output can be `f32` by not specifying the last Quantize operation.
- For the dynamic variant, the `scales` input is an `f32` tensor. The `zps`
input is optional and, when present, is an integer tensor (`s8`, `u8`, or
`s32`); it must be omitted for the FP8 data types (`f8_e4m3` and `f8_e5m2`).

## Implementation Limitations

1. Similar to floating-point SDPA, oneDNN primitive-based quantized SDPA is
   implemented as the reference implementation on both Intel Architecture
   Processors and Intel Graphics Products. The quantized SDPA patterns are
   implemented with quantized matmul (with post-ops) and `f32` softmax
   primitives. The reference implementation requires memory to store the
   intermediate results of the dot products between Query and Key which takes
   \f$O(S^2)\f$ memory. It may lead to out-of-memory error when computing long
   sequence length input on platforms with limited memory.
2. The quantized SDPA patterns functionally support all input shapes meeting the
   shape requirements of each operation in the graph.
3. CPU
   - Optimized implementation for the static variant is available for 4D Q/K
     tensors with shape defined as (N, H, S, D) and V tensor with shape defined
     as (N, H, S, D).
   - Optimized implementation for inference is available for OpenMP runtime and
     Threadpool runtime on Intel Architecture Processors.
   - Specifically for OpenMP runtime, the optimized implementation requires
     `N * H > 2 * thread number` to get enough parallelism.
4. GPU
   - Only primitive-based implementation is provided.
